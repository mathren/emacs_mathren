Tested and working with

emacs 26.3

 uname -a
Linux t490s 5.11.0-37-generic #41~20.04.2-Ubuntu SMP Fri Sep 24 09:06:38 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I manage my emacs configuration with GNU stow [[file:dot-emacs.d/README.org::*How%20I%20manage%20my%20configuration][here]].  See =README.org=
inside =dot-emacs.d/= for the description of the configuration itself,
which is described in literate org file. =dot-emacs= is auxiliary file
created by changing some emacs faces.
